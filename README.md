# ClauseClarity

ClauseClarity is a secure AI agent designed to be a personal AI paralegal for freelancers, solopreneurs, and small businesses. It eliminates the fear and uncertainty of signing client contracts by providing intelligent, personalized contract analysis against your specific business rules.

## How It Works

### 1. **Teach It Your Rules**

Create a private "Company Playbook" with your non-negotiables:

- "I must be paid within 30 days"
- "Liability must be capped at contract value"
- "Early termination clause required"

### 2. **Upload a Contract**

Just drop in the PDF you received from a client. Our AI securely processes it without storing your sensitive documents.

### 3. **Get a Simple Report**

Receive a color-coded analysis:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Clauses that comply with your rules
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Clauses needing attention
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Deal-breakers that violate your playbook
